Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, social restrictions and health fears generated changes in behavior and communication. But have these changes become permanent? In this Special Feature, we examine how and why the pandemic may have changed the way we behave and interact. We also spoke with three experts for insight into this emerging societal phenomenon. <br><br>

,<br>
By analysing samples from patients who have been treated for malaria in Sweden, researchers at Karolinska Institutet can now describe how the immune system acts to protect the body after a malaria infection. The results, published in the journal Cell Reports, provide knowledge that can aid in the development of more effective vaccines against the disease.<br><br>

					<font color="#000" size="36px"> HIV/AIDS Expansion in Africa</font> <br> <br>
,<br>

The global response to HIV and AIDS is at a critical juncture. Nowhere is this more evident than in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the global total of 34 million women and men living with HIV today, the vast majority—an estimated 23.5 million or 69 percent—live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the overwhelming majority—92 percent—of all pregnant women living with HIV and 90 percent of the world’s children living with HIV live in this sub-region. Women are particularly affected, representing close to 58 per cent of those living with HIV in the sub-region. The majority—71per cent—of all AIDS-related deaths worldwide in 2011 were recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Significant challenges continue to confront African Member States in the bid to achieve the objectives of the “Abuja Call” and the MDGs by 2015. By that year, the ILO intends to show evidence of a substantial reduction in new HIV infections and an increased level of resilience to HIV and AIDS among vulnerable men and women workers and their families.
